    waypoint is the location set by the mouse. every tick we rotate to face it
    then set our velocity forwards. velocity is (0,-1) because we are using
    rotation based movement. -1 in the Y axis means we go upwards in the Y 
    direction. (0,0) is topleft corner. rotation based movement means that going
    up in the Y axis actually makes the object move upwards relative to its own
    direction, causing the ship to go forwards in whatever direction its facing.
    
    stops moving if it is close to its destination.
